                <h2>Hinduhrudaysamrat Balasaheb Thackeray</h2>
                <p><b>Bal Thackeray</b>, in full <b>Balasaheb Keshav Thackeray</b>, (born January 23, 1926, Pune, Maharashtra state, India—died November 17, 2012, Mumbai), Indian journalist and politician, founder of the Shiv Sena (“Army of Shiva”) political party, and advocate of a strong pro-Hindu policy in India. Under his leadership the Shiv Sena became a dominant political force in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. Thackeray began his career in the early 1950s as a cartoonist for the Free Press Journal in Mumbai (Bombay). His cartoons also appeared in the Japanese daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun and in the Sunday edition of The New York Times. In the 1960s he became increasingly involved in politics. He developed a strong regional following through his work for a weekly Marathi-language journal called Marmik, which he published with his brother and which polemicized against the influence of “outsiders” in Maharashtra. In 1966 he founded the Shiv Sena. Although Thackeray never held an official post or ran for elective office, for years he was generally regarded as the most powerful man in Maharashtra. He was often referred to as the “godfather of Maharashtra” or, as his legion of devout followers called him, Hindu Hridaysamrat (“Emperor of the Hindu Heart”). His party advocated the end of India’s constitutional status as a secular state and the adoption of Hinduism as the country’s official religion. Such was Thackeray’s power that when the Shiv Sena gained political control of Maharashtra in the 1990s, he had Bombay renamed Mumbai for the goddess Mumbadevi—the name by which the city is known in the Marathi language—and when Thackeray was satirized by novelist Salman Rushdie in The Moor’s Last Sigh (1995), the book was immediately banned in Maharashtra.</p>
